# Programming-Geophysics-In-Python

## Course details

"Programming Geophysics In Python", which is a 5-day training course, was designed and taught by [Dr. Lutz Gross](https://sees.uq.edu.au/profile/9065/lutz-gross), the Associate Professor of Geophysics in School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at The University of Queensland, and his Ph.D student [Zhengguang Zhao](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhengguang_Zhao2) (seismic data processing topic only).
 
This course was firstly taught at [China University of Mining & Technlogy (Beijing)](https://www.cumtb.edu.cn/)(CUMTB) in October 2019. Around 150 postgraduate geophysical students from CUMTB took this 5-day training course. Later on, Dr. Lutz Gross taught this course at [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/). 

### Course outline
* Day 1: Basic Concepts of Python 
* Day 2: Arrays and data visualization:
  * matplotlib & numpy 
* Day 3: Numerical modeling for Geophysics 
  * esys.escript  
* Day 4: Seismic Data Processing  
* Day 5: Advanced Topics: Inversion

## How to use this tutorial

As most of examples in the Jupyter Notebook tutorials use Esys-Escript package as its backend, users needs to download and install it correctly on their own computers.

A more convenient way using VirtualBox to learn this course is also provided. Here are the steps to get your programming environment ready.
1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) host software;
2. Download [pythonescriptTutorial.ova](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DTYpM4xAg9yAxMBufJn7OQ ) with access code: g9eq ;
3. Use VirtualBox software on your OS to load the .ova file (File-->Import Appliance...);
4. Start the Debian Linux OS on the virtual machine and log in with account name 'student' and password 'escript';
5. Start Jupyter Notebook on Debian Linux OS via menu clicks (Applications-->Education-->Jupyter);
6. Use Jupyter to run tutorial/codes placed in the folder 'PythonTutorial' on the desktop.

Plese note this .ova file was created on 20 October, 2019. Updates hosted on this Github repository have not been added to the course materials.
